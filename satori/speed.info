This is really going to depended on the makeup of the pcap file, but tests below were run with a few files that were single type packets:

HTTP with UserAgent in it:
- output to screen: Packets/s: 2687.846614314404
- output to disk:   Packets/s: 6951.393647723584
- compare to Windows version:  909

DHCP with "3" different types of info being displayed on each:
- output to screen: Packets/s: 1633.4671705921742
- putput to disk:   Packets/s: 4557.845538705156
- compare to Windows version:  339

TCP
- output to screen: Packets/s: 1623.227164283516
- output to disk:   Packets/s: 4755.095848078051
- compare to Windows version:  233

To be fair on the window version of Satori, it does more than just determine the fingerprint, it is trying to search if the device is already in the system, update a timestamp, compute an over arcing score, etc, but it is still very slow in comparison to the new version!
