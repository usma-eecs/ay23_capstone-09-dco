current version of detection script. Detects both windows and linux machines, places results of script in "OS.log"
in zeek. This script should be placed in the "/opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/zeek/policy/custom" directory. Place the script in it's own directory,
call it whatever you want, and place the script in there and rename it "__load__.zeek"
